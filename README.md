The Eclipse Service Lifecycle Management (SLM) provides a set of applications to manage the lifecycle of AI (artificial 
intelligence) services in production environments. The service lifecycle consists of the release, deploy, and operate 
phase and exits with the decommissioning of the service. It has a connection to the software development lifecycle 
(idea, design, code, build, test) and the AI model development lifecycle (idea, data acquisition, data analysis, data 
preparation, model training, model evaluation). The Eclipse Service Lifecycle Management was initially developed in the 
[FabOS research project](https://www.fab-os.org) and transferred  after version 1.2.0 to the Eclipse Foundation. It is one of the 
core components of the FabOS platform.
